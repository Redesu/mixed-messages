# mixed-messages
 Project for Codecademy


# Overview


For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## What it does

Each time it runs it will generate 3 random messages. The program uses characters from the Shin Megami Tensei franchise. It tells which skill it used and what your actions needs to be. 
> Use the command bellow to run the program.

 `node main.js`
